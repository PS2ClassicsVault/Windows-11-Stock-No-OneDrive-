# Windows-11 Pro 22H2 Stock No OnDrive for Gaming!

Welcome to the new Windows 11 Pro 22H2 this is not your ordinary version of windows this is built for those who want to keep it stock as possible but with a few gaming tweaks and ## OneDrive ## removed or disabled by default.

# Introduction: #

Ever found yourself installing windows 11 pro for the 1st, 2nd 3rd or more times because "OneDrive" suddenly moves the following folders to "C:/Users/username/OneDrive"

and everytime you move it back to "C:/Users/username" and suddenly gets either moved back, breaks desktop or simply does not allow you to reset the path of them or even move the desktop folder etc to the place you want it?

Well you came to the right place Microsoft made an update to windows and this can happen even before you even enter your desktop leaving you fustrated that you tried to keep your desktop etc on your local drive and not on OneDrive this can lead to hackers obtaining information such as sensitive information you have in the following folders:

- Desktop

- Documents

- Photos

and your own microsoft account leaving it open to grab without your consent.

This build disables OneDrive from doing that such thing giving you the ability to take action and prevent future issues.

## Features: ##

Not only we made this improvment we also made some tweaks for gaming so you do not hae to enable to tweak them manually such as the following:

- Variable GPU Scheduling (Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling)

- Xbox Live Services auto start and stay on for better online gaming experience and less issues having to enable them.

- File Explorer will open "This PC" instead of "Home" to access your drives faster and easily.

- Hidden folders/files are no longer hidden from the user and Hide File Extensions are disabled by default so you know if the file you downloaded is a .exe file or not

- NET 3.5, Direct Play & Virtual Machine Platform is pre-enabled and installed

- Some bloatware has been removed such as Microsoft Office, News, Skype and more, however we have not removed pinned ad apps from start or windows so hey will still show, apps like xbox, mc store and basic apps are still included

-  Still have a drive filled with steam games etc and dont want to format your drive for steam etc to use it?...We included a new option in the context menu called "Take Ownership" witch allows you to transfer the ownership from the last pc or os install to your new OS install w/out the need of reinitializing the drive saving tons of time.
