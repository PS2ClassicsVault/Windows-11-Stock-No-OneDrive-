# Windows-11 Pro 22H2 Stock No OnDrive for Gaming! #

Welcome to the new Windows 11 Pro 22H2 this is not your ordinary version of windows this is built for those who want to keep it stock as possible but with a few gaming tweaks and OneDrive removed or disabled by default.

# Introduction: #

Ever found yourself installing windows 11 pro for the 1st, 2nd 3rd or more times because "OneDrive" suddenly moves the following folders to "C:/Users/username/OneDrive"

and everytime you move it back to "C:/Users/username" and suddenly gets either moved back, breaks desktop or simply does not allow you to reset the path of them or even move the desktop folder etc to the place you want it?

Well you came to the right place Microsoft made an update to windows and this can happen even before you even enter your desktop leaving you fustrated that you tried to keep your desktop etc on your local drive and not on OneDrive this can lead to hackers obtaining information such as sensitive information you have in the following folders:

- Desktop

- Documents

- Photos

and your own microsoft account leaving it open to grab without your consent.

This build disables OneDrive from doing that such thing giving you the ability to take action and prevent future issues.

## Features: ##

Not only we made this improvment we also made some tweaks for gaming so you do not have to enable to tweak them manually such as the following:

- Variable GPU Scheduling (Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling)

- Xbox Live Services auto start and stay on for better online gaming experience and less issues having to enable them.

- File Explorer will open "This PC" instead of "Home" to access your drives faster and easily.

- Hidden folders/files are no longer hidden from the user and Hide File Extensions are disabled by default so you know if the file you downloaded is a .exe file or not

- NET 3.5, Direct Play & Virtual Machine Platform is pre-enabled and installed

- Some bloatware has been removed such as Microsoft Office, News, Skype and more, however we have not removed pinned ad apps from start or windows so they will still show, apps like xbox, mc store and basic apps are still included

-  Still have a drive filled with steam games etc and dont want to format your drive for steam etc to use it?...We included a new option in the context menu called "Take Ownership" witch allows you to transfer the ownership from the last pc or operating system; to your new OS install w/out the need of reinitializing the drive saving tons of time & future fustration.

## FAQ: ##

- QUESTION: Why is TPM & Secure Boot Still required in this build?

ANSWER: We have not disabled this feature because it is required in order for Windows 11 to be stable as possible and act as if the OS was never altered, in our extensive testing we compared results from both a build with tpm and secure boot enabled VS a build that disables the requirements and have it off in our bios to simulate the pros and cons of them both. During our testing Windows 11 Pro without TPM/Secure boot enabled had issues that effected services and apps such as Xbox and caused issues such as not being able to properly detect if the drive selected for a game beyond defaults was empty or properly configured resulting the user to format that drive and lose any data stored on to it for it to work, it seems certain services rely on tpm in order to function properly. With a build of WIndows 11 Pro with TPM/Secure boot enabled, We saw no such thing as issues affecting services witch was more promising so we went this route; However the build will not stop you if you do use rufus and choose the no tpm/secure boot option, therfore we cannot provide support or take in reports if you proceed to go this route!


- QUESTION: Will OneDrive still install even though it's disabled by default?

ANSWER: Yes, though it gets auto installed by the MC store automatically, it will NOT auto enable or be enabled think of it as if it got hunted and shot by the virtual mafia and it's dead remains are still there never to be collected by the virtual police and only to be cleaned up by you, you can safely uninstall it in control panel; however if you're skeptical that it will still move the folders into the OneDrive folder such as we mentioned earlier in this readme, you can restrict permissions to that folder by going to "C:/Users/username" and look for the "OneDrive" folder, right click over the folder and click "Properties" then go to the "Security" tab and edit the permissions and deny every single available user in the window then click "Apply" or "OK" to apply the settings and a warning message may pop up warning you about removing previlidges but click yes to continue and then you are done click ok and windows nor apps can utilize that folder.
